### Game
This game has been developed following the tutorials [Introduction to Unity Scripting 1](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4180726-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-1) and [Introduction to Unity Scripting 2](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4180726-introduction-to-unity-scripting-part-2). 

## Improvements 
- The player can change the position of the Moving Bay using the keys A, S and D to place it on the top-right, center and top-left (respectively) of its moving domain. 
- If any sheeps collide with the moving bay they will disappear and will be counted as dropped/not saved. 
- The time between the spawn of sheeps decreases with time (they start appearing faster). 
- When the player saves 30 sheeps a "You win" text appears on the screen, all sheeps are destroyed and the Title scene is displayed (to play again or quite).
